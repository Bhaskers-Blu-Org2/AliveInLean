From alive-newsema/tests/instcombine.

answ.txt is the output of Alive (newsema branch).

opt116, opt117, opt118,opt119, opt120, opt121, opt122, opt123 are not supported in currenct semantics because they are converting select into logical ops.
Alive (with newsema branch) says they are incorrect as well.
